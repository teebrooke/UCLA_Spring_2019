# What You Should Know From Lecture: Week 2

### Monday pt 1:
#### Announcements-
* You have Homework that is due next Wednesday at 8:00:00 am. To get the assignment, paste the following link in your browser: https://classroom.github.com/a/E9rVxfnZ

 Follow the instructions. When you get to the window "You are ready to go! " go to the link that is next to the message "Your assignment has been created here:" This should lead you a repository with a document called “First_assignment.txt” with information about the Homework.

 __NOTE:__ You should now how add information to a file and clone/save/push a repository and. If you don’t remember how to do this, go to the W1 Version-control document available on the curse website.

* For discussion this week, you need to bring a draft of your CV.  You will learn to convert it to a Markdown document, and you will give each other feedback.

---

Hopefully you all moved the following documents into ~/Lecture_1/syllabus/partial_documents:
* final_project.txt                        
* Lab_assignments_participation.txt
* Homework.txt                           
* In_class_Participation.txt

Remember that they are stored in ~/classdata/Week1/Monday_in_class

If you have not done so use

```
[c177-i0@n2010 ~]$ cp  ~/classdata/Week1/Monday_in_class/final_project.txt  ~/Lecture_1/syllabus/partial_documents
```
```
[c177-i0@n2010 ~]$ cp  ~/classdata/Week1/Monday_in_class/Homework.txt  ~/Lecture_1/syllabus/partial_documents
```

etc...

---

We can past these file together using 'cat' which pretty much concatenates files together end-to-end. Lets move into the partial_documents directory and try the following

```
[c177-i0@n2010 partial_documents]$ cat Homework.txt  final_project.txt Lab_assignments_participation.txt Homework.txt In_class_Participation.txt
```

We will see the following

```
__Homework:__

This course includes a broad range of topics and tools. Practice is the best way to learn how to program and homework assignments will prepare you for in class activities. Homework assignments will help you learn and master basic programming skills. Homework assignments will be submitted electronically before class. The submission cutoff is 7:45 am the day of class. Late submissions will be accepted but penalized 10% each day late (submitting 7:46 the day of class counts as 1 day late).
__Final Project:__

The final project for this course will require you to produce software that manipulates and analyzes data.  This software must have a practical application for a current research project. If you do not currently have a research project will be paired with a researcher that has a computational need that is appropriate for the scope of the course and student group size.   Student group size will depend on the size of the program required for the research project and whether you are an undergraduate or a graduate student.

__Your final project will include and be evaluated based on the following criteria.__
* Cleaver or insightful program name.  Everyone loves a bad acronym.  
* Name and contact info for project members.
* Your Readme file.
* How well you justify the purpose of the program in the background / introduction of the readme.
* The clarity of the program workflow including the use dependencies.
* The instructions for running your program. The expected output of your program. The references cited in the readme.
* The completeness and effectiveness of scripts for accomplishing the research goal.  They can be written in Bash, Python, and or R.
* The clarity of the vignette for teaching the researcher to use the software and the presence of example data, example output, and run and error logs.
__Lab assignments / participation:__

You must attend computer lab. Computer lab assignments are designed to result in a practical product like a CV or website or to provide benchmarks and feedback on the final project. This is your opportunity to get immediate feedback on your final project and a good way to get personalized attention from Daniel.  All computer lab assignments must be turned in 15 minutes before your scheduled computer lab session.__Homework:__

This course includes a broad range of topics and tools. Practice is the best way to learn how to program and homework assignments will prepare you for in class activities. Homework assignments will help you learn and master basic programming skills. Homework assignments will be submitted electronically before class. The submission cutoff is 7:45 am the day of class. Late submissions will be accepted but penalized 10% each day late (submitting 7:46 the day of class counts as 1 day late).
__In class participation:__

You will work alone or in teams during class time to generate scripts, solve problems, and participate in class challenges. These activities are designed to test your understanding of your homework assignments and challenge you to think more creatively about programming. All in class activities must be turned in during class to the course GitHub. If you have an excused absence (criteria for an excused absence is detailed below), you will be given an alternate exercise.  The lowest in class assignment score will be dropped from your in-class participation grade.

You can verify that the file content is being added in order by looking at each file using 'head' or 'less'.

```
[c177-i0@login2 partial_documents]$ head Homework.txt

```

We can now make a new document to store this information using a redirect '>'.

```
[c177-i0@login2 partial_documents]$ cat Homework.txt  final_project.txt Lab_assignments_participation.txt Homework.txt In_class_Participation.txt > new_file.txt
```

Now lets see what is in the directory

```
[c177-i0@login2 partial_documents]$ ls
final_project.txt  In_class_Participation.txt         new_file.txt
Homework.txt       Lab_assignments_participation.txt
```

We can check out the contents of the file using 'less'

```
[c177-i0@login2 partial_documents]$ less new_file.txt

new_file.txt
```

Remember that "q" allows you to exit 'less'.

Lets remove new_file.txt

```
[c177-i0@login2 partial_documents]$ rm -i new_file.txt
rm: remove regular file `new_file.txt'? y
[c177-i0@login2 partial_documents]$
```

Remember that the -i flag asks you if you really want to do this.

Now, review the contents of the syllabus document in ~/Lecture_1/syllabus/full_document/

You can do this a number of ways...

```
[c177-i0@login2 partial_document]$ less ../syllabus/full_document/syllabus.txt
```

```
[c177-i0@login2 partial_document]$ cd ../syllabus/full_document/
[c177-i0@login2 partial_document]$ less syllabus.txt
```

etc

Now take note of the order in which the syllabus addresses the
`final_project.txt`
`In_class_Participation.txt`  
`Homework.txt`       `Lab_assignments_participation.txt`

Use cat to make a new document called 'course_assignments.txt' that puts the information from `final_project.txt`
`In_class_Participation.txt`  
`Homework.txt`       `Lab_assignments_participation.txt` in the same order found in the syllabus.

course_assignments.txt should look like the following:

```
__In class participation:__

You will work alone or in teams during class time to generate scripts, solve problems, and participate in class challenges. These activities are designed to test your understanding of your homework assignments and challenge you to think more creatively about programming.

Lets move this new document to the full_document directory.  We could make a copy of it using 'cp' but perhaps we do not need multiple copies of course_assignments.txt. You will use 'mv'.

```
[c177-i0@login2 partial_documents]$ ls
course_assignments.txt                 In_class_Participation.txt
Do_first_Build_directory_exercise.txt  Lab_assignments_participation.txt
final_project.txt                      syllabus.txt
Homework.txt
[c177-i0@login2 partial_documents]$ mv course_assignments.txt  ../full_document/
[c177-i0@login2 partial_documents]$ ls
Do_first_Build_directory_exercise.txt  In_class_Participation.txt
final_project.txt                      Lab_assignments_participation.txt
Homework.txt                           syllabus.txt
[c177-i0@login2 partial_documents]$ ls ../full_document/
course_assignments.txt  syllabus.txt
```

---

Wild cards are fun!  Say we now want to delete all of the text files in the partial directory  It can be done in a single command using a wildcard.

Before we get totally crazy lets just play with the wildcard ' * ' .

```
[c177-i0@login2 partial_documents]$ ls *_*.txt
Do_first_Build_directory_exercise.txt  In_class_Participation.txt
final_project.txt                      Lab_assignments_participation.txt
[c177-i0@login2 partial_documents]$ ls
Do_first_Build_directory_exercise.txt  In_class_Participation.txt
final_project.txt                      Lab_assignments_participation.txt
Homework.txt                           syllabus.txt
[c177-i0@login2 partial_documents]$
```

What was not displayed when we used the wildcard.  Basically we looked for any file name that contained one underscore.  
\* = any characters
so ' \*\_\*.txt ' means  a file with any characters up to an ' _ ' followed and any characters up to a .txt

syllabus.txt does not match because it lacks an underscore.

Try ls \*\_\*\_\*

What was returned?
`Do_first_Build_directory_exercise.txt`  `Lab_assignments_participation.txt`
`In_class_Participation.txt`

We can use wildcards to cp, mv, ls, etc.  We will learn wildcards other than '\*' later.

Try to delete all of the text files from Lecture_1/syllabus/partial_documents/

---

---

Another useful command is "wc". It prints newline, word, and byte counts for each file.

Lets look at the basics of the files in full_document

```
[c177-i0@login2 partial_documents]$ cd ../full_document/
[c177-i0@login2 full_document]$ ls
course_assignments.txt  syllabus.txt
[c177-i0@login2 full_document]$ wc *
   21   470  2896 course_assignments.txt
  339  4551 29370 syllabus.txt
  360  5021 32266 total
[c177-i0@login2 full_document]$ wc
^C
[c177-i0@login2 full_document]$
```
For course course_assignments.txt for example, wc gives us the number of lines = 21 the number of words = 470 and the number of bytes = 2896

__Note__: for Hoffman2 you need to use the wildcard to use wc on an entire directory.  I don't have to do this with my MAC

We can also just ask for the line counts

```
[c177-i0@login2 full_document]$ wc -l *
   21 course_assignments.txt
  339 syllabus.txt
  360 total
[c177-i0@login2 full_document]$ wc -l syllabus.txt
339 syllabus.txt
[c177-i0@login2 full_document]$ wc -w syllabus.txt
4551 syllabus.txt
[c177-i0@login2 full_document]$ wc -c syllabus.txt
29370 syllabus.txt
```
---

How do we transfer files from our computers to Hoffman2? You should already be able to do this using git.

There are several other ways to do this.  An easy one is through 'scp' but you need to be able to open a shell on your computer. The command is `scp [-r] path_source login_id@hoffman2.idre.ucla.edu:path_target` use -r if it is a directory rather than a file.

```
EMilys-MacBook-Pro-7:~ limeybean$ scp /Users/limeybean/Dropbox/UCLA_Spring_2019/Community_Ecology_2019/Community_Ecology_Syllabus_draft_1.txt c177-i0@hoffman2.idre.ucla.edu:Lecture_1/
c177-i0@hoffman2.idre.ucla.edu's password:
Community_Ecology_Syllabus_draft_1.txt        100% 1148    70.9KB/s   00:00    
```
It transferred successfully to hoffman2.

```
[c177-i0@login3 Lecture_1]$ ls
Community_Ecology_Syllabus_draft_1.txt  syllabus
```

We can also download an SFTP client for a MAC or PC [like cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/) or an app for [chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sftp-client/jajcoljhdglkjpfefjkgiohbhnkkmipm?hl=en-GB).

We can also use Globus. See the [presentation](https://dechavezv.github.io/eeb_C177_2019//lecture_pdfs/week2_Lecture_Globus.pdf) on the course website.


Another useful way to get things to Hoffman2 is by using 'wget'.  wget is a non-interactive network downloader.  This means it downloads stuff from the internet to Hoffman2 or to your computer.

Lets first make a nested directory ~/week2_monday/wget_test/, then 'cd' into it.

We are going to download something from the internet into the new directory wget_test

```
[c177-i0@login3 wget_test]$ wget ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1000genomes/ftp/README.populations

[c177-i0@login3 wget_test]$ ls

```
This file should contain the following text:

```
This describes the population codes which can be found in column 11 of the sequence
index file.

There are also two tsv files, which contain the population codes and descriptions for both the
sub and super populations
