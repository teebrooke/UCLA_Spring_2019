__Final Project:__

The final project for this course will require you to produce software that manipulates and analyzes data.  This software must have a practical application for a current research project. If you do not currently have a research project will be paired with a researcher that has a computational need that is appropriate for the scope of the course and student group size.   Student group size will depend on the size of the program required for the research project and whether you are an undergraduate or a graduate student.

Your final project will include and be evaluated based on the following criteria.
* Cleaver or insightful program name.  Everyone loves a bad acronym.  
* Name and contact info for project members.
* Your Readme file.
* How well you justify the purpose of the program in the background / introduction of the readme.
* The clarity of the program workflow including the use dependencies.
* The instructions for running your program. The expected output of your program. The references cited in the readme.
* The completeness and effectiveness of scripts for accomplishing the research goal.  They can be written in Bash, Python, and or R.
* The clarity of the vignette for teaching the researcher to use the software and the presence of example data, example output, and run and error logs.
