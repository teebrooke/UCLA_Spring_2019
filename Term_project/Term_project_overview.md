# Term Project
#### __Due Friday, June 14th at Midnight__

___

Do you plan to work as a biologist or other kind of scientist?  If so you will probably have to analyze a lot of data and you might generate computer programs to do this work. If you publish a paper using this data analysis you will need to make all of your scripts available to other researchers. Now is a great time to learn how to make your computer programs available to the world!

GitHub is becoming the goto place to make computer programs publicly available.  [There are many benefits to using GitHub](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/what-is-github-and-why-should-i-use-it-2071946) to post your work. It allows other people to try out your program and provide feedback or grow a project. Every change to your repositories are tracked using git so there is full transparency for every change that is made to a project. It is also good for networking and your profile acts as a resume of sorts. You can also add useful GitHub repositories to your CV. Just be aware that GitHub repositories are generally [open source](https://help.github.com/en/articles/licensing-a-repository) and need to be licensed appropriately.

The term project for this course will help you build your GitHub presence! It will require you to produce a program (or multiple small programs) that manipulates and analyzes data or that runs a useful computer simulation. This project must have a practical application for a current research project or course. If you do not currently have a project that meets this description, you will be paired with a researcher or educator that has a computational need.

To generate these programs and to build these GitHub repositories, students will work in groups of two or three people.  Group size will be determined by the scope of the program. The term project will include and be evaluated based on the following criteria.

#### The Title Information
  * A cleaver or insightful program name.  Everyone loves a bad acronym.  
  * Name and contact info for project members.

#### The Readme
  * __Introduction:__ This section indicates the purpose of the program and provides background and a justification for why the program was created.
  * __Program Workflow__:  This section provides an operation overview of what the program does.  A flowchart or some other diagram might be helpful, but is not required.
  * __Dependencies__:  To run a program users may need to have dependencies installed.  Indicate which dependencies are required for you program.
  * __Instructions__:  You need to indicate how your program is run.
  * __Expected Output__: Describe the files and or directories will be produced by your program.
  * __References__: Cite pertinent studies or programs that you used to develop your program(s).

#### The Scripts

  * You can use Bash, Python, and or R to write your program(s).
  * In addition to running your program, these scripts should output some sort of run log


#### The Vignette
  * This is critical for letting other people know that they are getting the correct output from your program.
  * It includes:
    * A small test dataset
    * The exact command needed to run this dataset with your program
    * The expected output of running your program using the small dataset.
